#summary Requirements for the project to be compiled.
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

Follows is a list of libraries and/or software required to compile the project from its source files.  An IDE is not required, but highly recommended.


= Details =

Required Libraries:
  * GLU
  * GLEW
  * GLFW

Required Libraries for Linux:
  * GLX

Currently all other libraries are pre-installed with MSVC or GNU GCC compilers, though make sure to grab the up-to-date GLEXT.H, WGLEXT.h and GLXEXT.H from the opengl.org website.

To download the above libraries on Ubuntu based distributions for Linux:
{{{
sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev libglew-dev libglfw-dev
}}}
This should use your synaptic package installer to install the required libraries to your system including the necessary drivers.  On Linux once these are installed, compile the application via Code::Blocks project provided in the repo and it should "just work"

Windows only requires you to install GLEW and GLFW, to get the 32-bit binaries of these, you can go to their website and download them, install them to someplace like: "C:/glew" and "C:/glfw" and set up Code::Blocks to recognise those two directories as the base directory for $(#glew) and $(#glfw) global variables.  I will later write a walkthrough to prepare those.  Too busy right now.
