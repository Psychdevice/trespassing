
The Utilities folder contains all of our utility libraries, we prefer to use custom made ones as they are typically
optimised for the project and can be easily debugged if need be.

-- Exception
The Exception Utility is our form of error sending and receiving, the game should throw exceptions when something
goes wrong, especially during a non-recoverable process such as file loading, if a file doesn't exist, it should
throw a "File Not Found" Exception.

-- Array
The Array Utility is an optimised container object that operates like a C-Array, it occupies contiguous memory
and cannot be resized, an Array cannot be reused either, it must be deconstructed and constructed again for reuse.

-- String
The String Utility is a lightweight container for C-Strings, again in contiguous memory, the strings are NULL
terminated, but can be added together and have various actions performed on them such as searches and tokenising.

-- IOStream
The IOStream Utility is a lightweight container for Input/Output Streams such as files.
[ NOTE ] May need to split it into OStream and IStream and derive FStream from those.
