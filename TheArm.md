The existing implementation of the player arm works okay but really requires some more constraints/limitations.  With modern hardware within the last 2-3 years, the arm mechanic would look good even as it is with just a much better, high-poly arm which would help hide distortion of dynamic animation.

What bugs most players is the inability to use both arms, somehow working in the ability to use the left arm to, eg; push a crate, or open a door while holding a weapon in the right hand, would be incredibly useful and more immersive, you'd also feel like a person and not an arm with cleavage to the side.

Weapon handling also bothered many players, a way to rectify this is to limit how we use them, perhaps once a weapon is equipped, the player would right click to ready the weapon (or hold right click) and then adjust the angle of the weapon within the view before firing (left click) if the camera is unable to pan, this allows a bit more control in terms of where the gun will fire at, it also would force players to really time their use of fire arms far more appropriately.  Hip firing could still be a possibility, simply left click while the weapon is lowered, will lift it rapidly to fire from the hip with a much more increased spread and higher recoil, but good for panic scenarios.
