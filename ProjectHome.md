Trespassing is a project run by fans to revisit the island of Isla Sorna off the cost of Costa Rica, an island rented to InGen in the 1980's to the 1990's before the Isla Nublar Incident and the San Diego Incident.

Boasting a physics based game world in which the player interacts with even the most mundane of items, a true survival mechanic and the thrill of being hunted by ferocious, prehistoric predators.

The project is targeted at Windows and Linux users, specifically Windows 7/8 and Ubuntu distributions.
